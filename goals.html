				<p>>One of our many goals is too clean as much waste out of our oceans by the year 2026. 
				Currently we have 5.2 trillion tons of waste in our oceans, we plan to almost halve that in the near future</p>
				<img src="images/Oil.jpg" alt="Oil" width="350" height="200">
				<p>We plan to try clean as much oil out of our water as possible. Oil in our water causes a small layer of film to form 
				and this blocks out sunlight and kills life and plants. We plan to help stop oil drilling in the ocean and reduce oil spills.</p>

				<p>Rising sea levels cause people to lose homes and family. Our goal is to set up a relieve fund so that people who's home get destroyed 
				have a fall back. 	We also set up more call lines and rescue centres in highly dangerous areas.</p>

				<p>Protecting our sea life from poachers is another one of our many goals. Currently hundreds of species are being hunted and extinct because of 
				poachers. We plan to ban poaching and help law enforcment crack down on poachers and illegal hunting of sea life.</p>
